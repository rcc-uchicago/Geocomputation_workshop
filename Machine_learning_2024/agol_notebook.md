### **Using ArcGIS Online Notebooks for Deep Learning**

ArcGIS Online Notebooks provide a powerful platform for performing deep learning tasks within a geospatial context. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with deep learning projects using ArcGIS Online Notebooks.

---

#### **1. Accessing ArcGIS Online Notebooks**

- **Sign In**: Log in to your [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/) account. Ensure you have the necessary privileges to create and use notebooks.
- **Navigate to Notebooks**: From the main dashboard, go to **Content** > **Notebooks**. Click on **New Notebook** to create a fresh notebook.

#### **2. Setting Up Your Notebook Environment**

- **Choose a Runtime**:
  - **Standard Runtime**: Suitable for most deep learning tasks.
  - **Advanced Runtime**: Includes additional libraries and tools needed for complex models.
  - **Advanced with GPU**: Best for intensive deep learning computations requiring GPU acceleration.
  
  *Select the runtime that aligns with your project requirements.*

- **Install Necessary Libraries**:
  ```python
  # Example: Installing TensorFlow and Keras
  !pip install tensorflow keras
  ```

#### **3. Preparing Your Data**

- **Import Data**: Load your geospatial datasets into the notebook. You can use data from your ArcGIS Online content or external sources.
  ```python
  import arcpy
  import pandas as pd

  # Example: Reading a feature layer
  feature_layer = "https://services.arcgis.com/your_feature_layer_url/FeatureServer/0"
  data = pd.DataFrame.spatial.from_featureclass(feature_layer)
  ```

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess your data to make it suitable for deep learning models.
  ```python
  # Example: Normalizing data
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

  scaler = StandardScaler()
  data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature1', 'feature2']])
  ```

#### **4. Building Your Deep Learning Model**

- **Define the Model Architecture**:
  ```python
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

  model = Sequential([
      Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(data_scaled.shape[1],)),
      Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])
  ```

- **Compile the Model**:
  ```python
  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```

#### **5. Training the Model**

- **Train the Model**:
  ```python
  history = model.fit(data_scaled, labels, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
  ```

- **Monitor Training**: Use visualization libraries to monitor training performance.
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='accuracy')
  plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label = 'val_accuracy')
  plt.xlabel('Epoch')
  plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
  plt.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

#### **6. Evaluating and Using the Model**

- **Evaluate Performance**:
  ```python
  loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data_scaled, test_labels)
  print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%")
  ```

- **Making Predictions**:
  ```python
  predictions = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
  ```

- **Integrate with ArcGIS**: Use the modelâ€™s predictions within your ArcGIS maps and analysis workflows.
  ```python
  # Example: Adding predictions to a GeoDataFrame
  data['predictions'] = predictions.argmax(axis=1)
  data.spatial.to_featureclass(location="path_to_save_predictions")
  ```

#### **7. Sharing Your Notebook**

- **Save and Share**: Once your deep learning project is complete, save your notebook. You can share it with peers or publish it as a web tool for others to use.
  - Click on **File** > **Save**.
  - To share, select the notebook and choose **Share** to set permissions.

### **Required Privileges**

To effectively use ArcGIS Online Notebooks for deep learning, ensure you have the following privileges:

- **Create and Edit Notebooks**: Ability to create new notebooks and modify existing ones.
- **Access to Advanced Runtimes**: If your project requires advanced libraries or GPU acceleration, ensure your account has access to the **Advanced** or **Advanced with GPU** runtimes.
- **Manage Content**: Permissions to access, upload, and manage geospatial data within your ArcGIS Online organization.
- **Publish Web Tools**: If you plan to deploy your deep learning model as a web tool, you need the **Publish web tools** privilege.

*Contact your ArcGIS administrator if you need to adjust your privileges.*

### **Tips for Success**

- **Leverage Samples**: ArcGIS Online Notebooks offer sample notebooks. Use these as a starting point to understand workflows and best practices.
- **Utilize Documentation**: Refer to the [ArcGIS Notebooks documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-notebooks/) for detailed guidance and advanced techniques.
